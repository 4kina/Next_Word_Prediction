# Next_Word_Prediction
My project for the Data Science Capstone course on Coursera

This application is a Capstone project of the [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) held by John Hopkins University and SwiftKey company. Based on the NLP techniques and the Markov chain model, the algorithm predicts the next word the user is most likely to type. You can try this app here:
